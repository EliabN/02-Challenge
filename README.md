# My Portfolio

A Web Portfolio that showcases my works and experiences through out my coding/programming journey.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
